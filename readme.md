Single Process Mean, Variance and Median Value Calculation
==========================================================
In this homework, I wrote a simple single process python script (simplescripts.py).

The script reads from a bzip2 format file, which store a collection of historical 
airline arrival departure information.

*View the [source of the data.](http://eeyore.ucdavis.edu/stat250/Homeworks/hw1.html.)*

The single process script extracts information in the column "ArrDelay" or "\"ARR_DELAY\"".

Then, we get the mean, variance and median.

*The script ignores the NA fields in the sample data.

Results from simplescripts.py:
------------------------------

Mean: 6.56650421703

Variance: 995.801720331

Median: 0.0

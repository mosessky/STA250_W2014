Homework 4. Github Pullrequest Visualization
=================================================
This is part of another course project. I gathered 18 most popular github repositories' pull request information and analyzed their developers' pull request merging pattern. 
Here, I use four repos to represent the work. They are Akka, Boto, Django, and Mongo.
 
Move the cursor on any node, you will see the developer it represents and how that developer collabor with other developers.

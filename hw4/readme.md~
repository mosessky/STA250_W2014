Homework 4. Github Pullrequest Visualization
=================================================

Initial Draft
-------------------------------------------------

Now, I test several initial algorithms (LinearSVM, BernoulliNB, MultinomialNB, NearestCentroid, SGDClassifier, SGDClassifier, L1LinearSVC, PassiveAggressiveClassifier, Perceptron).

The performance score is based on F scores (balanced result among accuracy and recall).

In simple words, I found NearestCentroid has best F score on test dataset.

Seen from above figure, NearnestCentroid and BernoulliNB has desired score compared with other algorithms.
